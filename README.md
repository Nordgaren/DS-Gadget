# This version of DS Gadget has been created for InfernoPlus' "Remastest" mod and contains various changes to item lists.
A multi-purpose testing tool for Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition. Compatible with the current Steam and debug versions as well as, in theory, everything else.  
## Requirements 
* [.NET 4.6.2](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/thank-you/net462)
* [VC Redist 2012 x86](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679)  

You probably already have both.

## Installing

* Extract contents of zip archive to it's own folder. You may have to run as admin if DS Gadget crashes

## Updating

* If you have a previous version of DS Gadget Local Loader with a Resource folder, there is no need to copy the resource folder over, unless noted in the patch notes. This prevents you from overwriting the changes you made and the saved positions you stored.

## Troubleshooting
If you are having problems getting it to launch and you tried installing the packages above, right click the exe, go to properties, hit the compatability tab and hit "Run compatability troubleshooter". If it works, apply the settings windows found.  

You can also try adding DS Gadget as an exception to your antivirus

# Change Log  

###  Prerelease 0.14.4)  
**Update to Resources/Systems/Bonfires.txt, Resources/Equipment/Rings/Rings.txt, Resources/Equipment/Items/Spells.txt, Resources/Equipment/Items/UsableItems.txt, /Equipment/Weapons/SpellTools.txt and Resources/Equipment/Weapons/Shields.txt**  
* Added heal timer cheat. When the player takes damage, start a timer fully heals the player when finished. Timer duration is user-defined, and resets when taking additional damage during its duration

* Item menu "Max" checkbox now also sets item quantity to maximum

* Quick Select Bonfire checkbox restores vanilla DS Gadget functionality of immediately changing your bonfire when one is directly selected from the bonfire list (Bonfire searching, arrow keys, and other misc selectors will not trigger quick select bonfire)

* Keyboard functionality extended to player tab bonfire combo box and item tab infusion combobox (up, down, enter and escape)

* Config now updates with player and adds temporary "unknown" configs to list if the game sets the player with an unknown config (If you see an unknown config and are playing an unmodified game, please tell us!)

* Bonfires.txt updated so that Ash Lake Entrance and Ash Lake Dragon are no longer swapped  

* Spells.txt, Spelltools.txt, UseableItems.txt and Rings.txt updated to reflect vanilla item names in parenthesis  

* Shields.txt Fixed Bonewheel Spiked and Pierce Shield having incorrect infusion paths.  

###  Prerelease 0.14.3)
**Spells.txt and Rings.txt updated**

* Added TTT items  

* Added 1.4 beta items  

###  Prerelease 0.14.2.7)

* Minor patch, now up to date with Vanilla Gadget.

###  Prerelease 0.14.2.6):

###  Prerelease 0.14.2):

* Fixed an issue where DS Gadget couldn't find files after launching from Windows search.  

**Thank You [King Borehaha](https://github.com/kingborehaha/) for:**
* "Last Set" Bonfire feature puts the last bonfire you warped to at the bottom of the list of bonfires
* Various bugfixes and minor improvement on the code side
* Code Cleanup and Bug fixes

###  Prerelease 0.14.1):

* Saved stats improvement and various minor bugfixes 
* UI improvements for 0.14 features by [King Borehaha](https://github.com/kingborehaha/)
* * Fixed an issue where DS Gadget couldn't find files after launching from Windows search (0.14.2.1).

###  Prerelease 0.14): 

**If you already have changes to your DSItemCategory and DSFashionCategory text files, you can move them to Resources/Equipment after installing. I changed where the Gadget looks for them.**  

* Added Bonfire search  

* Added Team Config  
	* Correctly loads the Chr and Team type for each existing combo.  
	* Does not change to correct color for covenant, even though correct value. I think the mtd gets changed on invasion  
	* Loaded from Resources/Systems/TeamConfigs.txt  

* Can now get max upgrade items with a checkbox, instead of typing it in all the time  

* Stats menu now has a checkbox to apply any changes to your character made while character is unloaded  

* Cleaned up Search Bar presentation and can now use Escape to clear search  

###  Prerelease 0.13): 

* Added saving stored positions to XML file which are loaded on DS Gadget Startup

    * Press the store position key or enter after typing a location name in the combo box for the stored position to save or update that positon.
    * Press Shift + Del or click the "Delete" button to delete the stored location.
    * XML file can be edited, but you must re-launch the gadget.

* Merged with [DS-Gadget 3.0 Local Loader](https://github.com/kingborehaha/DS-Gadget). Item lists and categories now editable via a text file in Resources folder.  

* Added local category loading for Item and Fashion categories and split Ammo into it's own category.

    * Resources/DSItemCategory.txt is for the dropdown categories in Items tab, Resources/DSFashionCategory.txt is for the dropdown in the Misc tab for fashion.
    * Categories must consist of items of the same Category ID. For instance, Ranged Melee and Ammo all share the weapon category ID, so you could make a "Favorite Weapons" category that has a combination of those items. Current Item lists are all sorted into their respective category IDs as a guide.
    * Make sure to setup a new item list at Resources/Equipment/Category/YourNewCategory.txt for your category and copy-paste items from other lists to that new text file. Make sure your new category references the correctly named text file!
    * The order in the file is the order in the dropdown menu

* Added Toggle AI Hotkey.

* Gadget now allows you to change any setting that isn't loaded upon loading a character.

###  Prerelease 0.12):

###  Prerelease 0.3):
* Bug fixes
* Some changes from Prerelease 1.1 did not function properly: Rename of "Black Eye Orb(s)" did not function properly due to character limit, name shortened; Fix of "Skull Lantern bug" not working due to restrictions within item category definitions.

Original readme:

# DS Gadget
A multi-purpose testing tool for Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition. Compatible with the current Steam and debug versions as well as, in theory, everything else.  
Requires [.NET 4.6.2](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/thank-you/net462) and [VC Redist 2012 x86](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679)  
You probably already have both.

# Instructions 
Extract the entire Gadget folder to wherever you want, and run DS Gadget.exe.  
Once the game is running, Gadget will automatically attach; if the Version is displayed in green everything should work correctly.  
If it's orange, your game version isn't fully supported and some things may not work. I recommend finding a newer one.  
All features are disabled until you load a character (indicated by the Loaded text).  
When you shut down Gadget, active modifications like cheats and filters will be reset.

If you get the following error when using certain features, uninstall and reinstall the VC Redist linked above:  
`System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly 'Fasm.NET.dll' or one of its dependencies.`
